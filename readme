# medical cost predictions

In this notebook try to build a better predicting model to estimate medical cost
of person. in here use linear regression models using ordinary least square, gradient
decent, ridge regularization (L2), lasso regularization (L1), and polynomial methods.

# dataset

dataset use in here is medical cost prediction dataset from **kaggle**. you can find it from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/mirichoi0218/insurance">here</a>.
